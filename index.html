        <h1>My biography if you want to know me better</h1>
        I was born and lived in Ukraine until February 24, 2022.<br>
        Since school time, namely in the 8th grade, my parents bought me a computer, and from this time began my journey into IT.<br>
        At school in computer science class, I met C++. And almost all my free time I wrote simple console applications for fun.<br>
        At the time of choosing a university, I clearly understood that I wanted to tie my professional career with programming.<br>
        I was enrolled in the National Technical University "Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute" at the Department of Energy at the Department of Automation and computer-integrated technologies.<br>
        At university, I continued to code in C++, but in my lectures, I was taught C#. And I fell in love with C#.<br>
        When I got my master's degree, I worked at Automation Spirit Alliance company where I was doing industrial process automation<br>
        and my duties included software design based on the documentation from the design department and writing the same software based on Siemens s7-1500 controllers and SCADA WinCC.<br>
        I also had experience in writing solutions for industrial test bench with LabVIEW software.
        During the Automation Spirit Alliance, Siemens held training conferences on Node-RED, which could be used in a new version of the software from Siemens.<br>
        Node-RED is a graphical programming interface written in modules using JS based on Node.js. From that moment I got interested in JS language, which opened me to the world of Web Development.<br>
        And I decided to learn how to create backend web applications. I started with PHP because PHP was recommended on various forums as the easiest language to enter and understand MVC architecture.<br>
        During this period, I learned how to use MySQL Doctrine Nginx and phpMyAdmin. But during the study, I did not like the syntax of PHP because it is quite cumbersome.
        And my colleague advised me to look towards Node.js.<br>
        I quickly switched to JS code because in some ways these two languages were similar, and I just had to understand the differences.<br>
        After I had a solid understanding of Node.js, I decided to use Nest.js as my framework because it offers MVC and SOLID rules out of the box, unlike express, and it reminded me a bit of the familiar Symfony.<br>
        Next, I studied the basic principles of Nest.js under the mentorship of my colleague, who advised me of this framework and Node.js in general.<br>
        Now my knowledge stack is as follows:<br>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Nest.js</li>
        <li>TypeORM</li>
        <li>Swagger</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Docker</li>
        I'm actively trying to find my first haven in real Web development to develop my skills!<br>
        Due to the situation in my home country Ukraine, I am considering moving to absolutely any place in North America except Mexico.<br>
        I am currently in Bogota Colombia.<br>
